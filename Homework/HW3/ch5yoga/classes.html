                <dd>Intended for beginners and anyone wishing a grounded foundation in the practice of 
                    yoga, this 60 minute class of poses and slow movement focuses on asana (proper 
                    alignment and posture), pranayama (breath work), and guided meditation to foster 
                    your mind and body connection.
