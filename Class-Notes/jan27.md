### Getting Started With HTML
---

| Component | How to Declare | Description |
| --------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Document Type | !DOCTYPE html | a declaration that tells a web browser which version of HTML a document is written in |
| Header | head (with closing that has /head) | a container that holds metadata (data about data) such as the web page title |
| Body | body (with closing that has /body) | a tag that defines the documents body which contains all the elements of an HTML document

### Example Code From Class:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>First Example of Class</title>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Main Heading</h1>
        <h2>Second Heading</h2>
    </body>
</html>
```

*As mentioned before, title is the title of the web page. For the meta charset="UTF-8", it is an HTML tag that makes it possible to use emojis and other characters that aren't in the traditional ASCII character set on your webpage. h1 and h2 are different declared headers within the body of the code. This is for bolded things and titles of a main topic, etc.*
