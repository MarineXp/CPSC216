                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>&ThickSpace;We developed a smart irrigation system for farmers and small residential gardens or planters. 
                    The project integrates the Internet of Things (IoT) and engineering into farming and gardening culture. 
                    Our system is marketed towards consumers who want to create a garden without worrying about keeping up with the daily hassle of maintaining the growth of the plants. 
                    This system combines soil moisture sensors and weather forecasts to control irrigation schedules. 
                    In addition, a user interface for customization and monitoring is utilized to reduce water waste by providing irrigation only when necessary. 
                    This interface allows for users to customize and monitor the irrigation system with the goal of ensuring plants receive adequate water for optimal growth.
                </p>
                <p>&ThickSpace;Ensuring accurate and even water distribution across the entire garden is a key challenge in maintaining an irrigation system. 
                    Furthermore, weather is a detrimental factor in the healthy upkeep of gardens, but it can also accentuate mistakes made by users. 
                    We have recognized that all gardens, residential or commercial-sized, are distinct from each other and require various kinds of maintenance. 
                    All gardens have various plants, so homeowners or commercial business owners can customize them. 
                    However, customization can lead to an insufficient maintenance system for a garden. 
                    Inconsistent watering leads to much more substantial dilemmas, such as plant stress and root rot. 
                </p>
                <p>&ThickSpace;Our project is motivated by the desire to merge engineering with horticulture, relieving the burden of maintaining garden irrigation. 
                    It is not just about creating a smart irrigation system for small gardens but also about setting the stage for future scalability. 
                    We envision a system that can adapt to gardens of all sizes, from small pots to large residential plots, efficiently meeting users' needs across all industries.
                </p>
                <p>&ThickSpace;The smart irrigation system's user interface was created with homeowners in mind, making it simple to set up and use. 
                    Users are taken through an easy setup procedure that requires little technical knowledge as soon as the system is installed. 
                    Homeowners can adjust irrigation settings according to plant species, light levels, and garden zones. 
                    With simple access to real-time monitoring and management, users can easily modify plans and react to weather variations from any location, whether at home or on the road. 
                    We have created a user interface that displays the soil's current moisture levels and provides other important information for optimal plant growth.
